    <p>
    In HTML, a tag and an element are often used interchangeably, but they have slightly different meanings.
    <br>
    <br>
   <b>Tag:</b> A tag is a keyword or a phrase surrounded by angle brackets < and >. It is used to define the start and end of an element. There are two types of tags: opening tags and closing tags. Opening tags are used to start an element, and closing tags are used to end an element.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Element:</b> An element is a building block of an HTML document. It represents a piece of content, such as a paragraph, image, or link. An element consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag. Elements can also have attributes, which provide additional information about the element.

<!-- example st -->
Let's take the example of a paragraph element:

<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>

In this example:

<p> is the opening tag, which indicates the start of the paragraph element.
This is a paragraph of text. is the content of the element.
</p> is the closing tag, which indicates the end of the paragraph element.
The entire construct, including the opening tag, content, and closing tag, is the paragraph element.
