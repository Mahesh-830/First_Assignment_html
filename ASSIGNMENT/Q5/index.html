    The DOCTYPE declaration, also known as the document type declaration, is an essential part of an HTML document. It is the first line of code in an HTML file and is used to inform the web browser about the type of document it is dealing with.

    The DOCTYPE declaration tells the browser which version of HTML the document is written in, and it helps the browser to render the page correctly. It also enables the browser to switch to a specific mode, such as "standards mode" or "quirks mode", depending on the DOCTYPE used.

    A doctype declaration in HTML is a line of code that tells a web browser what version of HTML a document is written in. It's the first line of code in an HTML or XHTML document, and it appears before the tag.
<br>
<br>
    The most reliable doctype declaration to use is the one defined in HTML5, which is <!DOCTYPE html>. If you need a doctype that matches a specific version of HTML, the declaration must be exact, both in spelling and case.
