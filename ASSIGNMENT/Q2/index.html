    <p>
        Comments in HTML are used to add notes or explanations to the code, making it easier for developers to understand the purpose and functionality of different parts of the code. Comments are ignored by web browsers and do not affect the rendering of the HTML document.

        The purpose of comments in HTML is to:

        <li>Explain the code: Comments can be used to explain what a particular section of code is doing, making it easier for others (or yourself) to understand the code later.</li>
        <li>Debug code: Comments can be used to temporarily disable a section of code to debug an issue.</li>
        <li>Add notes: Comments can be used to add notes or reminders to the code. </li>
</li>
<br>
In HTML, comments are denoted by the <!-- symbol, followed by the comment text, and ended with the --> symbol.

    <!-- This is a comment, it will not be displayed in the browser -->
	<h2>HTML defines the content and structure of your website</h2>
	<!-- This section of code is for adding a paragraph of text -->
