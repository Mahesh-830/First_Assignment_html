            What is web development?
        </h1>
        <p>
            Web development is the process of building websites and apps for the internet—or for a private network known as an intranet. Web developers bring the design and functionality of a website to life, writing code that determines things like style, layout, and interactivity. From the most simple, static web pages to social media platforms and apps; from e-commerce websites to content management systems (like WordPress)—all the tools we use via the internet have been built by web developers. 

There are three different types (or layers) of web development: The frontend, the backend, and database technology. Frontend development, otherwise known as client-side scripting, encompasses all the elements of a website that the user experiences directly. Things like layout, font, colors, menus, and contact forms are all powered by the frontend.

Backend development, or server-side scripting, is all about what goes on behind the scenes. When you interact with a website in some way—for example, filling out a form and clicking “submit”—the frontend communicates this action to the backend. The backend responds by sending the relevant information to the frontend—for example, the code needed to display a message such as “Thank you for filling out this form”. 

The third layer comprises database technology. The database contains all the files and content that are necessary for a website to function, storing it in such a way that makes it easy to retrieve, organize, edit, and save. 

The frontend, backend, and database technology all work together to build and run a fully functional website or application. As such, these three layers form the foundation of web development.

    <h2>What does a web developer do?</h2>

<p>
    Broadly speaking, web developers are responsible for building and maintaining websites and apps. This involves writing code, identifying and fixing bugs, and collaborating with key stakeholders and designers to ensure that the products they’re building meet the needs of both the business and the user. However, the exact role of the web developer varies depending on whether they specialize in frontend development, backend development, or the full stack.

    <h2>What are the typical skills, traits, and background of a web developer?</h2>
<p>
    First and foremost, the best web developers are passionate about what they do. They’re natural problem-solvers who relish the challenge of seeking out bugs and errors and coming up with solutions. This goes hand-in-hand with patience and perseverance. As a developer, you’ll frequently encounter obstacles—be it a pesky bug or a product that just isn’t working as you’d imagined. For some people, these are hurdles to be jumped, with immense satisfaction at the end. For others, they’re a major source of frustration. If you’ve got passion, patience, and problem-solving skills in abundance, you’ve got the makings of a web developer!

In addition to problem-solving, web developers are builders at heart. They use languages, libraries, frameworks, and a whole host of other tools to build things from scratch—beautiful, fully-functional, user-friendly things like websites, apps, and databases (to name just a few). Web developers therefore tend to enjoy, and be good at, discovering how different components fit together to form an end product. 

Last but not least, it’s important to bear in mind that a career in web development isn’t all computers and coding (although that is a large part of it). Whether you work in-house for a company or as a freelancer with clients, you’ll collaborate with a variety of key stakeholders —such as designers, product managers, and fellow developers. Communication skills are crucial, together with an understanding of how your work impacts both the customer or the end user and the overall business. 

As you can see, web developers tend to be keen problem-solvers and curious learners with a knack for building and developing user-centric solutions. Does that sound like you? Check out this guide to figure out if you’re truly a great fit for a career in web development.
