    <h1>WEB DESIGN</h1>
    <p>Web design is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and arranging content online. Today, designing a website goes beyond aesthetics to include the website’s overall functionality. Web design also includes web apps, mobile apps, and user interface (UI) design, and user experience (UX).</p>

    <h3>Finding Inspiration</h3>
    <p>Designers look for inspiration everywhere. Having an idea of the overall look and feel of your website can help you choose a tool and begin to conceptualize your website layout. Here are some of the best sites to help get your creative juices flowing: 

       <li>Behance</li>
       <li>Pinterest</li>
       <li>Awwwards</li>
       <li>Web design inspiration</li>
       <li>Site Inspire</li>
    </p>

    <h3>Choosing a Web Design Tool</h3>
    <p>There are two main ways to design a website: using a desktop app or using a website builder. The tool you decide to use will vary greatly based on your team size, your budget, and the type of site you wish to build and its technical requirements. </p>
<li>Desktop Apps</li>
<p>Desktop apps require designers to create their design and send it to a development team who can then convert the design to code. The most popular desktop apps for designing websites are Photoshop and Sketch. 

    Typically, this is the standard for large and/or complex websites. The benefits of using a desktop app include:
    
    Designers can focus on the overall look and feel of the website 
    Technical challenges are transferred to developers 
    The website is not limited to the feature set of a website builder
    Unfortunately, this process can be expensive and time-consuming because multiple resources, skill sets, and team members are required. 
    
    To avoid involving a developer, it is beneficial to use a website builder to design a website with fewer technical requirements. </p>
<li>Website Builders</li>
<p>There are many website builders on the market today that offer a wide range of features and services. Wix, Squarespace, Webflow, and Pagecloud, are just a few examples of popular website builders that vary in design capabilities, template options, price, and overall editing experience. Be sure to do your research, experiment with free trials, and determine which platform best fits your website needs. 

    Website builders create either adaptive or responsive websites, which offer different building experiences. These concepts will be discussed in more detail below so you can best understand which builders will work for you. If you don’t know how to code, becoming familiar with the freedoms and limitations of various website design tools is essential. For example, although Wordpress is the most used website platform, it’s not popular with visual designers because of its limited customization options.  
    
    Before you start building a website, determine your website needs: Are you creating a photo gallery? How often will you update your site? Do you need a contact form? Choose a website builder that can help you effectively accomplish those goals. </p>
